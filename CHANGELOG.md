### Technical Details

#### Parameters
- **Threshold (τ)**: 3 (bypass prediction threshold)
- **Training threshold (θ)**: 68 (confidence threshold for training)
- **Learning rate**: 1 (conservative learning)
- **Weight range**: 6-bit signed (-32 to +31)
- **Feature tables**: 6 tables × 256 entries each

#### Features (Address-as-PC-Proxy)
1. Address bits 6-11 (PC proxy shifted by 2)
2. Address bits 7-12 (PC proxy shifted by 1)
3. Address bits 8-13 (PC proxy shifted by 2)
4. Address bits 9-14 (PC proxy shifted by 3)
5. Tag bits (address bits 12-17)
6. Page bits (address bits 15-20)

#### Files Modified/Added
- `akita/mem/cache/perceptron_victimfinder.go` (NEW)
- `akita/mem/cache/victimfinder.go` (MODIFIED)
- `akita/mem/cache/directory.go` (MODIFIED)
- `akita/mem/cache/writeback/directorystage.go` (MODIFIED)
- `akita/mem/cache/writeback/builder.go` (MODIFIED)
- `akita/mem/mem/protocol.go` (MODIFIED - added WithInstPC methods)
- `mgpusim/amd/samples/runner/report.go` (FIXED - cache metrics bug)
- `mgpusim/amd/samples/runner/timingconfig/r9nano/builder.go` (MODIFIED)
- `scripts/comprehensive_test.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/test_perceptron.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/compare_performance.sh` (NEW)

### Performance Results

#### Test Configuration
- **Workload**: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SPMV)
- **Matrix sizes**: 1024×1024 to 8192×8192
- **Sparsity**: 0.01 (1% non-zero elements)
- **Flags**: `-timing -trace-mem -report-cache-hit-rate`

#### Initial Results (8192×8192)
- **Perceptron**: 1,237,124 hits, 101,528 misses (92.41% hit rate)
- **LRU**: 1,256,449 hits, 101,707 misses (92.51% hit rate)
- **Miss reduction**: 0.17%

### Known Issues
- Perceptron currently shows slight underperformance vs LRU
- Training integration not yet fully implemented
- Parameters may need tuning for GPU workloads

### Future Improvements
- Complete online training integration
- Parameter optimization for GPU workloads
- Add GPU-specific features (wavefront ID, instruction type)
- Implement sampling mechanism from MICRO 2016
- Support for additional cache levels (L1, L3)

## Development Notes

### Build Requirements
- Go 1.24+
- SQLite3
- bc (basic calculator)
- MGPUSim and Akita dependencies

### Testing
```bash
# Single test
~/compare.sh spmv -dim 2048 -sparsity 0.01 -timing -trace-mem -report-cache-hit-rate

# Comprehensive test suite
cd perceptron_research && ./scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

# Verification test
cd perceptron_research && ./scripts/verify_perceptron.sh
```

### Final Implementation Status (August 3, 2025)
- ✅ Perceptron fully integrated into L2 cache
- ✅ Training on cache hits and evictions working
- ✅ Online learning verified (weights evolving from 0 to -192)
- ✅ Feature extraction functioning correctly
- ✅ Ready for performance evaluation and tuning
