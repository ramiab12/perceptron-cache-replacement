# Perceptron Cache Replacement Implementation - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully implemented a perceptron-based cache replacement policy for the L2 cache in MGPUSim GPU simulator, based on the MICRO 2016 paper "Perceptron Learning for Reuse Prediction."

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. **Core Perceptron Implementation**
- Created `akita/mem/cache/perceptron_victimfinder.go` with full perceptron logic
- Implemented 6 feature tables (256 entries each) as per MICRO 2016 paper
- Used address-based feature extraction as PC proxy for GPU context
- Implemented hashing and XOR indexing for table access
- Added online learning with saturating counters (-32 to +31)

### 2. **Integration with Cache System**
- Extended `VictimFinder` interface with `FindVictimWithContext` method
- Integrated perceptron into L2 cache via `writeback/builder.go`
- Modified `directorystage.go` to provide context for victim selection
- Added `GetVictimFinder()` method to Directory interface

### 3. **Training Integration**
- **Cache Hits**: Added `TrainOnHit` calls in `handleReadHit` and `doWriteHit`
- **Cache Evictions**: Added `TrainOnEviction` calls in `evict` function
- Perceptron learns from actual cache behavior during simulation
- Training updates weights based on prediction accuracy

### 4. **Key Features Implemented**
```go
// 6 features extracted from address (as PC proxy)
features[0] = uint32((addr >> 6) & 0x3F)   // Address bits 6-11
features[1] = uint32((addr >> 12) & 0x3F)  // Address bits 12-17
features[2] = uint32((addr >> 18) & 0x3F)  // Address bits 18-23
features[3] = uint32((addr >> 24) & 0x3F)  // Address bits 24-29
features[4] = uint32((addr >> 30) & 0x3F)  // Address bits 30-35
features[5] = uint32((pid) & 0x3F)         // PID as feature
```

### 5. **Configuration**
- Enabled perceptron for all L2 caches in R9 Nano configuration
- Added `.WithPerceptronVictimFinder()` to L2 builder
- Ensured memory tracing and cache hit rate reporting enabled

## 📊 Testing Results

### Verification Tests Showed:
1. **✅ Perceptron Initialization**: 16 L2 cache instances with perceptron
2. **✅ Feature Extraction**: Diverse features from addresses
3. **✅ Predictions**: Active prediction making (sum evolving from 0 to -192)
4. **✅ Training**: Heavy `TrainOnHit` activity showing learning

### Example Training Activity:
```
[PERCEPTRON] Initialized PerceptronVictimFinder: threshold=3, theta=68, learningRate=1, tables=6x256
[PERCEPTRON] Prediction #0: addr=0x10001b100, features=[4 34 49 24 27 3], sum=0, threshold=3, predictNoReuse=false
[PERCEPTRON] TrainOnHit: addr=0x1001e3480, features=[18 41 52 26 35 60] (block was reused)
[PERCEPTRON] Prediction #6100: addr=0x1001e5480, features=[18 41 20 42 37 60], sum=-192, threshold=3, predictNoReuse=false
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **akita/mem/cache/perceptron_victimfinder.go** (NEW)
2. **akita/mem/cache/victimfinder.go** - Extended interface
3. **akita/mem/cache/directory.go** - Added GetVictimFinder()
4. **akita/mem/cache/writeback/directorystage.go** - Training integration
5. **akita/mem/cache/writeback/builder.go** - Perceptron option
6. **mgpusim/amd/samples/runner/timingconfig/r9nano/builder.go** - L2 config
7. **mgpusim/go.mod** - Local akita dependency
8. **akita/mem/mem/protocol.go** - Added WithInstPC methods

### Key Algorithms:
- **Prediction**: Sum weights from 6 tables, compare to threshold
- **Training**: Update weights based on prediction error
- **Victim Selection**: Prefer blocks predicted as "no reuse"
- **Weight Update**: Bounded increment/decrement with theta check

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

1. **Compilation Errors**: Fixed missing WithInstPC methods
2. **Zero Metrics**: Fixed cache hit rate tracer injection bug
3. **SQLite Float Handling**: Added integer conversion for bash
4. **Git Submodules**: Removed .git directories for proper tracking
5. **GitHub Push**: Created repository before pushing
